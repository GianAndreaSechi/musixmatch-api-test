### ⚛️ ReactJS
This repo is to have a simple ReactJS (using Create-React-App) using the MusiXMatch API call.
NOT already mobile ready (i haven't still implemented media query in the CSS).
It has a simple graphics (MusiXMatch like), module, routing and click handler.
You have to inserto your MUSIXMATCH API KEY into url methods.

### 🐘 JS-PHP
This one is a simple app where you can find a simple WebApp using Bootstrap as a graphic template.

I also write two  modules (located into JS-PHP/api-methods) where you can find two simple calling via PHP.
You have to inserto your MUSIXMATCH API KEY into 'api-methods/api-config.php' and 'js/utility.js'
