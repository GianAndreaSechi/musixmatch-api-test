## 🎶 MusiXMatch API test in PHP, JavaScript, ReactJS and C# (coming...)


### ReactJS
This repo is to have a simple ReactJS (using Create-React-App) using the MusiXMatch API call.
It has a simple graphics (MusiXMatch like), module, routing and click handler.

### JS-PHP
This one is a simple app where you can find a simple WebApp using Bootstrap as a graphic template.
The css graphics is MusiXMatch website like and call the api via JavaScript.
I also write two  modules (located into JS-PHP/api-methods) where you can find two simple calling via PHP.
